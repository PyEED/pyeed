## What is PyEED?

PyEED is a Python toolkit, that allows easy creation, annotation, and analysis of custom sequence data. All functionalities are based on a data model, which integrates all information on a given nucleotide or protein sequence in a single object. This allows the bundling of all information on a given sequence, making it available in all creation, annotation, and analysis steps. The entire system is generic and is also capable of modeling different scenarios.

## PyEED data structure

The object structure of PyEED is based on a [data model](https://github.com/PyEED/pyeed/blob/main/specifications/data_model.md)(1), describing the relation between all attributes of a sequence. These attributes include the sequence, the organism, and annotations of the sequence. Furthermore, the information is marked with annotations, marking the origin of the information.

1.   PyEED uses the [sdRDM framework](https://github.com/JR-1991/software-driven-rdm) to define the architecture of its data as a Markdown document. The hierarchical structure defined in the Markdown document is used to generate Python classes, mirroring the structure of the data model. PyEED can thus be used to read and write data from SQL databases and apply its tools to the data.
