# Setup a Local BLAST Database

A local blast can be set up enabling faster searches. In the following, the clustered nr protein database from NCBI will be installed locally. Therefore, at least 250 GB of free disk space is required.

1. [Download](https://osf.io/gqxva) the clustered `.fasta` sequences.
2. Create a folder in the location where you want to store the database.
3. Unzip the downloaded file and move the `.fasta` files to the created folder.
4. Search for `haeussma/blast` in the search bar of the Docker Desktop application and click on `Pull`.
