Docker is a way to run software in a container. This means that the software is isolated from the rest of your system. This simplifies the installation of computing environments since everything is preconfigured in the container. Docker is comparable to running a virtual machine, but instead of installing a whole operating system, it only installs the software you need.


Here we will use Docker to install JupyterLab, a popular web-based environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. This will allow you to run JupyterLab on your local machine without having to install Python, Jupyter, and the necessary Python tools to work with your data and EnzymeML.

To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
